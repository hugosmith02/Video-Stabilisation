There are two python files 'Basic Algorithm.py' and 'Complex Algorithm.py'.

'Basic Algorithm.py' - Ensure the directory is the zip folder.

There are 2 cells.

Execute the first cell, this imports the marker video and saves each frame as a jpg in the directory.

Execute the second cell, this applies the basic stabilisation algorithm and produces a video of the stabilised marker.
A better video of this is in the files under 'Stabilised Marker Video.mp4'.

'Complex Algorithm.py' - Ensure the directory is the zip folder.

There are 2 cells.

Execute the first cell, this imports the video and calculates the transforms.

Execute the second cell, this applies the complex stabilisation algorithm and produces a video of the stabilised lecture.
A better video of this is in the files under 'Stabilised Lecture Video.mp4'.

The algorithm applied to other videos is also present.

'Stabilised Rotation Video.mp4'
'Stabilised Running Video.mp4'
